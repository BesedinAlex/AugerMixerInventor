# Auger Mixer in Autodesk Inventor

This program was written to automatically create Auger Mixer in Autodesk Inventor which was my coursework back in university days.

## Build

This is basic Windows Forms .NET app so you just need Visual Studio to compile it. Beforehand you need to add a reference with it to Inventor Object Library (autodesk.inventor.interop.dll). Usually it can be found on path `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Autodesk.Inventor.Interop\*`.
