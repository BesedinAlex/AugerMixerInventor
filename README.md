# Auger Mixer in Autodesk Inventor

Automatically builds an Auger Mixer in Autodesk Inventor. User needs only to look at technical drawings and set up sizes if needed. It also checks if Inventor works or not, so you app won't crash if you make it build a part or assemble without Inventor launched. In order to assemble parts, you have to create them (better let app to make it) and save. Assemble button will make you to open parts. Then it will assemble them. Has no practical use since you have to write a lot of code to make parts automatically. It is much faster to create it in Inventor directly.

It was a task for "Programming in CAD" discipline. That's why namespace is named BesedinCoursework.

To compile it you might need to connect project to Inventor Object Library.

Inventor Object Library: "DISK:\Program Files\Autodesk\Inventor YEAR\Bin\Public Assemblies\Autodesk.Inventor.Interop.dll"
